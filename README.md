## Insurify Project

* Run the commands in build.sh
* Navigate to http://localhost:5000/boards/South+Station
* or go to http://localhost:5000 and click on a board link, boards with no data will return an error, boards with / in names is an improvement that needs to be added in
* note we are ignoring warnings because they are tied to pandas updates that are made down the line, for a real app I would fix these
